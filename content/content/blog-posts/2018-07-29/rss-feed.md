We now have an RSS feed for this website!

<!-- end excerpt -->

Go check out our [RSS feed](/rss.xml)!

At CPS we believe strongly in creating easy ways to access data. When we make software we try to make it as easy as possible for people to get the relevant data that they need when they need it.

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) exists to make it easier to track updates to the contents of websites in a standardized format. In this regard setting up an RSS feed was a natural choice for us (a reader-friendly API to access our content). All the information is already up here, and you could have got all the information from the site by scraping it, but a good API is so much better for you as a consumer. If you like our content we want to make it easy for you to get it!

We see this as part of our broader philosophy of making data easer to work with, using open standards and protocols greatly increases the efficiency of sharing information.
