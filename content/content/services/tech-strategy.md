Technology exists in a broader context in businesses and organizations.
Even in the most technological of projects there will always be important non-technical components.
We have had an ongoing interest in the context of which tech projects are done.
By understanding the context better we are able to solve the business needs far more efficiently. Sometimes this means taking non-technical approaches to problems traditionally seen as tech and vice-versa.

We are well situated to provide advice on the following:

* If a problem is well suited to a technological solution and the profitability of such a solution compared with other options.
* Staffing and hiring decisions. We can give advice on both the impact of skills required and the overall market for candidates.
* Technical leadership and team management.
