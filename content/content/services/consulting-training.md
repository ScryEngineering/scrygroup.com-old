## Learning, reimagined.

You've hired top talent, grown your client base and taken on exciting new projects. But you have a problem: your crew needs to build their skills, and you're not sure where to turn. 

You dread the traditional training experience - boring PowerPoints and uninspired presentations. Time for something that keeps your team engaged and gets results. 

When it comes to learning, there's no substitute for direct experience - working side-by-side a team of experts who guide you through the entire process. We love teaching talented teams how they can be more efficient, effective and productive. That's why we deeply integrate consulting *with* training - to set our knowledge free AND deliver a high-quality product, that your in-house team helped to create.

With extensive experience in and countless stories from the trenches of software consulting, training and development, we engage your team as partners, not students, from the first day.

### The problem with traditional consulting and training

Traditional consultants create tangible deliverables (studies, reports, etc.), but they don't teach you their creative process, so you're unable to reproduce these projects using your in-house staff. You're left with a single deliverable that hopefully yields value, but you'll need to hire the consultant again if you need another deliverable. And trainers may teach you *how* to do something, they don't actually *create* the final product. Obviously, this costs your organization valuable time and revenue. You need a more cost-effective solution.  

### We don't just teach you how to use technology. We teach you how to learn.

While most training programs use a top-down approach to teaching new tools and concepts, today's constantly evolving technological landscape demands a hands-on, interactive approach to skills development focused on experiential learning.

We believe people learn best by doing. Instead of talking *at* you, our experts in data science, machine learning and mathematical optimization work *with* you to build internal capacity to create the products you'll use on a continual basis.

**You learn the tips, tools and techniques from industry experts who show you exactly *what* to do and *how* to do it, step-by-step!**

We work together to create specific, high-quality deliverables that directly result in ROI for your organization. During our project, we teach you how and when to use the same cutting-edge technologies and meta-cognitive strategies we use every day (and when *not* to use them). Topics are tailored to your specific requirements. From learning about machine learning, open technology stacks and developing Python programming skills to knowledge transfer, improving communication and stakeholder management, you'll acquire valuable new expertise.

With this framework, you'll build the capacity to execute these projects in-house - **no consultants required**.



## What you'll learn

An effective training program teaches a hybrid of cutting-edge technical skills and essential interpersonal skills that get your team results. The skillsets we teach include:

### Technical Tools & Techniques

These are the fundamental technical skills you'll use across a diverse range of projects:

- Technology stacks
- Visualizations
- Process automation
- Python programming
- QA (Quality Assurance) and testing tools



### Skills 

#### Interpersonal Skills 

These interpersonal skills are the foundation of an effective, productive and focused team:

- Communications
- Stakeholder management

#### Learning Skills

Essentially, these are the skills you use to effectively learn new concepts:


Metacognitive skills (Planning, problem solving, goal-setting, etc.)

- Scheduling and sequencing of learning
- Domain specific learning topics



## How we work

No cookie cutter PowerPoints here! We believe a truly effective consulting and training program is results-driven and customized to your team's needs. That's why we work closely with you to build a strategy based on your needs, strengths and goals.

Here is our approach:

**1. Define your needs:**

We meet with you to understand your team's existing skills, knowledge, strengths and areas to improve. We spend time understanding *your* industry niche better, as better domain knowledge leads to better results. 

**2. Build a custom strategy**

Every team is different, and yours requires a unique approach to achieve your desired results. We learn the context of the industry you work in, and how your team fits within this larger context. Together we build a custom strategy with the precise mix of consulting and training needed to reach your goals. This includes identifying critical skills and knowledge gaps that need to be filled.

**3. Work with your team** 

Time to put our strategy into action! Working in collaboration with your developers, IT and technical support staff on a specific project, we use tools and tactics tailored to your team, needs and workflow.

**4. Get ready to learn** 

While we work, your team learns the vital "hard" and "soft" skillsets, as well as the tools and techniques to successfully execute projects in-house.
